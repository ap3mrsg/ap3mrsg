### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**ap3mrsg/ap3mrsg** is a âœ¨ _hotmess2021_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-  Iâ€™m currently working on keeping some top notch security. 
-  Iâ€™m currently learning that anyone who is an ex with a demi god mentality can control all your technology.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on why I even had kids with this individual.
-  Iâ€™m looking into how I can keep him from monitoring my life. 
-  Ask me about why I am so broke these days, I couldn't tell ya.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Text or email me PLEASE!
-  Pronouns: Some days I feel that it's not a creepy stalky situation, but that's only on some days.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I love computers and in return would love to collaborate, do grunt work, etc. If you are willing to teach me.
